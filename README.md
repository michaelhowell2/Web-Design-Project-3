# Michael Howell project-1

This is my project-3 repository for class. Not as Tight as I wanted it to be like my mockup. Had trouble getting some of the sizes and paddings to sync the way I thought they would. I used class instruction, w3schools.com, and I bought three Duckett hard cover books for a good price and used these all as resources. Only working pages arethe home page and Sponsors page. Had issues getting this to git hub
